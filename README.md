rader Performance Analysis Using Bitcoin Fear–Greed Index
A Data Science Project by Priyanka Banerjee

This project analyzes how Bitcoin market sentiment (Fear & Greed Index) affects a trader’s performance, including:

Profit/Loss (Closed PnL)

Win-rate

Leverage behavior

Time-of-day performance

Sentiment-based trading strategies

Predictive modeling (Regression + Classification)

The analysis is divided into two Jupyter notebooks:
✔ Notebook 1 — Data Cleaning + Merging + Basic EDA
✔ Notebook 2 — Advanced EDA + Modeling + Strategy Insights

Dataset Description
1. Historical Trading Data

Includes trader execution logs such as:

account

symbol

execution price

size

side

time

closedPnL

leverage

event

start position

token size

2. Fear–Greed Index

Daily Bitcoin sentiment score (0–100) with:

Date

Sentiment Classification (Fear/Neutral/Greed)

Sentiment Score

Both datasets are merged on trade_date ↔ sentiment_date.

🔧 Technologies Used

Python

Google Colab

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn

Statsmodels

SciPy

CSV + PNG outputs

 Notebook 1 (Summary)

✔ Loaded & cleaned both datasets
✔ Parsed timestamps and normalized numeric fields
✔ Applied forward-fill to sentiment data
✔ Merged sentiment with trading data
✔ Exploratory Data Analysis:

Daily PnL trends

PnL distribution

Sentiment-wise average PnL

Output saved:
processed_trades_with_sentiment.csv

Notebook 2 (Summary)

✔ Feature Engineering:

hour

day_of_week

is_win

cleaned leverage & size

✔ Advanced Analysis:

KDE, scatterplots

Hourly & daily PnL

Win-rate by sentiment

Heatmaps

Correlation matrix

✔ Statistical Test:

Mann–Whitney U (Fear vs Greed)

✔ Machine Learning:

Linear Regression (predict PnL)

Logistic Regression (predict Win/Loss)

✔ Strategy Backtests:

sentiment > 40 / 50 / 60 trading rules

total PnL comparison

Output saved:
processed_with_extra_features.csv

 Key Findings

Greed periods show better PnL and win-rate

Fear periods result in more losses and higher risk

Leverage is dangerous during Fear but workable during Greed

Time-of-day affects performance

Sentiment improves model predictability

Sentiment-based threshold strategies improve results

Conclusion

Bitcoin sentiment is a powerful indicator of trader performance.
By combining sentiment with leverage and time features, we can:

✔ Improve risk management
✔ Identify profitable periods
✔ Build smarter trading strategies

This project demonstrates how market psychology directly impacts trading outcomes.
